###### short for repair it

a project where one can prove he can _DEVELOP_.

> Since I used to be a electronics repairer I said to myself why not make your first project relatable so you can enjoy it while learning?

So, here we are.

This project is still in EARLY development and hopefully it'll be finished soonTM. Uhh, enjoy it if you can then.
