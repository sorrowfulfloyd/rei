### Initial Goals

- [x] WE REALLY HAVE TO CHECK IF THOSE PARAMS ARE GOOD ASAP, STANDRALIZE IT WITH IF ELSE.
- [ ] Group the get all devices and get-a device-by-id into single get function.
- [ ] Expand the schema for more device types. (TVs, mobile phones, game consoles, etc.)
- [ ] Implement OAuth
- [ ] Research more on Schema.Add() for more fields to be filled by the users based on their needs, thus making the database modular.
      (I.e. User is a TV repair shop that also accepts satellite boxes with the TV's for repair, but we don't have that in the base Schema() so the user can expand it.)
- [ ] Study what's for the backend to handle and what's for the frontend to handle.

### Later Goals

- [ ] Implement auto backups
- [ ] Make the database local for modular packaging.
